# Thermoregulated sRNAs

Here we provide the scripts that reproduce the results and figures of the paper Gyula et al. 2018.
These scripts are not meant to be reusable. Download this directory and run the PCE_read_processing.sh script first which downloads sRNA-seq, Degradome-seq, and RNA-seq reads from the SRA database and process them. Then one can run the PCE_sRNA-seq.sh, PCE_Degradome-seq.sh, and PCE_RNA-seq.sh Linux shell scripts from this directory root. The results are placed in the sRNA-seq, Degradome-seq, and RNA-seq directories. Most of the figures and tables underwent post-processing in Excel, Powerpoint, or other GUI softwares, therefore the results will not exactly be the same as they appear in the paper.
